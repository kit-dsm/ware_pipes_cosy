**ware_ops_pipes** is a library for automated and context aware pipeline synthesis of warehouse operations problems.
Together with `ware_ops_algos`_, ``ware_ops_pipes`` forms the meta-model framework **Data Driven Decisions for Logistics (3D4L)**.

Framework Overview
============


The 3D4L framework consists of four main components:

🏭 **Data Layer and Domain Objects** (``ware_ops_algos``)
   To deal with heterogenous data sources, warehouse information is organized into domain objects: Layout, Articles, Orders, Resources, and Storage.

🛠️ **Algorithm Repository** (``ware_ops_algos``)
   Modular implementations of algorithms for item assignment, batching, routing, and scheduling. Each algorithm is annotated with its requirements via algorithm cards.

⚙️ **Domain-Algorithm Mapping** (``ware_ops_algos``)
   Filtering mechanism that identifies applicable algorithms based on instance characteristics and algorithm requirements.

🔄 **Context-aware Pipelines** (``ware_ops_pipes``)
   Uses `CLS-Luigi`_ to automatically generate all feasible algorithm combinations as directed acyclic graphs.
